					<p id="bio_text">Since its founding at Brockton School in 2004, the World Music Program (WMP) has graced the stages of concert halls and outdoor venues in Canada, the US, Asia, and Europe. Students involved in this program create and perform musical works that are the expression of their own unique musical voices. Through inquiry, exploration, and reflection, students engage in a co-creative process that empowers them and provides a supportive vehicle for the development of compassion, self-awareness, and collaboration.<br />~<br /><i> "I was very impressed with the performance, creativity, and enthusiasm of the World Music Program!  It's so important for students to have the opportunity to express themselves creatively. You have provided that - and the confidence that naturally comes with this type of empowerment and self-expression - in abundance!"<br />~ Ivy Lerner-Frank: First Secretary and Trade Commissioner, Education and Science and Technology, High Commission of Canada (Canadian Embassy in Beijing, China) </i><br />~<br /> The WMP performed at the UNESCO-founded International Society of Music Education (ISME) international conferences in Greece and China, as representatives for innovative, global music education. The WMP also represented Canada at the Aberdeen International Youth Festival, one of the largest and longest-running youth performing arts festivals in the world. The program has received invitations to perform at outreach events, school shows, cultural events, and festivals, both locally and internationally. In February, 2016, the WMP was honoured to have the opportunity to perform for Canadian astronaut, Colonel Chris Hadfield, along with 5,100 educators at the FISA convention, held at the Vancouver Convention Centre. In May 2016, the program made their first recording with a Grammy Award-winning producer. In March 2017, the program won Gold at a competition at New York City’s historic Carnegie Hall (the WMP was one of four high schools chosen worldwide to participate in this competition). During their NYC tour, they performed at the New Jersey Science Center, and gave outreach performances in rehabilitation centers in Harlem. Members of the ensemble have participated in BC’s Intercultural Week, in collaboration with the North Shore’s Immigrant Inclusion Partnership. In July 2018, the WMP will embark on a tour to Austria, the Czech Republic, and Germany, where they will take part in the Summa Cum Laude Music Festival in Vienna, Austria. While in Austria, the WMP will give a feature concert in one of Europe’s greatest concert halls, the Golden Hall/Musikverein in Vienna, as well as a fundraising concert for victims of the Chernobyl disaster in Ybbs an der Donau. Throughout their European tour, students will performance in various locations, such as elder-care homes, the AGNES Live! Festival in Prague, spa towns, and at Vienna's amusement park Prater. Students will also visit historic sites, including concentration camps, museums, and Canada House Embassy in Berlin.</p>
